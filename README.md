# Algorithms-PrincetonOnCoursera

Exercises from the [Algorithms course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), provided by Princeton University.

'Lessons' folders (e.g. [here](/src/edu/princeton/algorithms/sorting/lessons)) contain the data structures/algorithms covered in that chapter of the course. Not a requirement, but I've reimplemented them for the learning experience. 
 
'Assignment' folders (e.g. [here](/src/edu/princeton/algorithms/sorting/assignment)) contain the assignment from Princeton.
