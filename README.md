# Algorithms-PrincetonOnCoursera

Exercises from the [Algorithms course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), provided by Princeton University.

'Lessons' folders contain the data structures/algorithms covered in that chapter of the course. Not a requirement, but I've reimplemented them for the learning experience. 
 
'Assignment' folders contain the assignment from Princeton.
